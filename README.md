1. Find the twin primes up to a certain range.
   (Twin prime means successively two prime prime. Example: {3,5} but not {7,9})

2. Write a program to find the second highest of three number.

3. Convert a decimal number to it's equivalent binary, Octal and
   Hexadecimal and vice-versa.

4. Write a program that accepts a positive integer in any base and convert
   to any other base. The base values are to be given as input to the
   program and the base ranges should be within 2 to 16.

5. Write a program to find out the 2s complement of a number.
   Store it in another variable. Exchange the values using Bitwise operator.

6. Write a program, which will ask to enter two set of integers.
   Then perform the following set operations
   * Intersection.
   * Union.
   * Minus.

7. Write a program to find the number of duplicate elements in an array.
   Eliminate those duplicates if any. Example: Input: 1 3 5 1 2 3 1 6 5.
   Output: The number of duplicates= 3. After elimination - 1 3 5 2 6.

8. Write a program to evaluate the range of data types in C language
   (without library function or constants).
   Example: For Character the range is -127 to +128.

9. Every even integer greater than 4 can be expressed as the sum of two odd
   primes, like 6=3+3, 8=3+5, and so on.
   Write a program to generate such combinations for all the even integers
   from 6 to 100.

10. Write a program that checks whether a number is divisible by 11 or not
   (without division operation).

11. Write a program to sort a set of elements using sort and merge sort.
